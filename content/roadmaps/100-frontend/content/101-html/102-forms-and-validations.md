5)Radio
6)Checkbox

There are two actions available with the forms the GET and POST the GET method appends the data to the url where as POST method sends data in JSON format.

Before submitting data to the server, it is important to ensure all required form controls are filled out, in the correct format. This is called client-side form validation, and helps ensure data submitted matches the requirements set forth in the various form controls.
